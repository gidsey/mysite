# Wagtail Hosting

Demo [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) hosting setup using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) and 
[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

See my tutorial blog post [Hosting a Wagtail site on Digital Ocean with CapRover](https://medium.com/@Gidsey/hosting-a-wagtail-site-on-digital-ocean-with-caprover-e71306e8d053) for a full explanation.   
From [Django News](https://django-news.com/); "This tutorial walks us through creating a Docker-friendly Wagtail website that ends with launching the website on Digital Ocean using CapRover."
